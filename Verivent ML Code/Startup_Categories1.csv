 Join us and be part of the next big thing in preschool education Think globally act locally Glocal is a concept in education that is used to connect global and local contexts It is associated with the familiar terms such as global citizenship education or education for sustainable development Globalized learning focuses on blending and connecting local and global contexts when teaching and learning concepts that apply across different levels of scale in fields such as sustainability and environmental science Learning becomes effective when put into local context because children are better able to relate to the content and material through familiar examples The focus becomes discovering the connections between the local issues and the global concepts studied during class In Dreamkids children learn about how they can practically apply sustainable development concepts that affect their local communities In this way they are more likely to take meaningful actions because they have an easier time grasping concepts that are locally and culturally relevant For example children could learn about climate change by understanding weather patterns in their region they could learn about world hunger caused by desertification and create a local food drive in their communities or they could learn about the importance of recycling by tracking a product that they use everyday through the product lifecycle We believe that changing attitudes and values is not enough and for education to be effective we need to show children how they can act on behaviours We need to remove any barriers to taking action For children behaviours are greatly influenced by personal factors and peers so they need to see their peers teachers and school communities promoting and taking the same action We seek to achieve this through the following four steps Learning and understanding concepts through global themes and trends Using examples in reallife contexts and experiences Taking meaningful action Reflecting With our specially designed Dreamkids Glocal Education we seek to nurture happy and empathetic global citizens and problem solvers who want to make the world a better place Raising happy children who want to change the world through their big dreams and little actions to make it a better place and share our passion to impact more children and parents in the world with our dream early childhood education we welcome to be part of our family as a franchisee 3 reasons to work with us 1 We believe in education first business second Many preschool businesses or franchises fail because they go by business first education second forgetting that building a successful education business goes beyond just a curriculum or operating system but a strong missionbased culture built together by teachers parents and children 2 We are franchiseefocused meaning that we want as our franchisee to be successful when embarking on this remarkable journey with us because we know that when they are successful we are too 3 We are a crazy team of passionate early childhood educators and entrepreneurs who want to impact the lives of children and parents through our work in early childhood education In other words as part of our Dreamkids family it would surely be a fun and meaningful one ,9,others

 Increase in levelized cost of energy LCoE due to depleting in solar tariff worldover has created some sense of fear in the minds of solar plant developers For making it commercially competitive the only way forward is to maximize yields and improve their ROI The only way forward for higher yield is to use solar PV tracking technology to harness the sun to its fullest potential The existing tracking systems are single axis tracker SAT and dual axis tracker DAT unfortunately both are not too effective The SAT has shortcomings in design and the DAT is too expensive to be economically viable Critically analysing the market demand we have innovated a new enhanced solar tracking technology which disrupts the existing single axis tracker and is called 2Axis Tracker It overcomes the inherent design disadvantage of the single axis thereby offering a near dual axis tracker performance at the cost equivalent to single axis tracker Key features of our innovation are Rotates solar module in two different directions unlike the SAT The angle of incidence of the sun s irradiation on the module is always close to perpendicular at all times and in all seasons of the year whereas the angle of incidence in a single axis tracker is effective only during the summer The performance recorded is 2x to 3x over SAT at any location on the globe This results in tremendous improvement in the IRR 2Axis Tracker has an ideal design advantage for bifacial solar modules Innovation is the nextgeneration technology which replaces and overcomes existing SAT technology hence rendering it obsolete The design is jointly developed with IIT Delhi and incubating in their premise The design advantage of our tracking system coupled with other technological advancements in modules and inverters has made tracking systems a more lucrative business proposition than the conventional systems earlier According to Fortune Business Insights the global solar tracker market size was USD 9 30 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach USD 22 33 billion in the next 6 years growing at a CAGR of 12 6 Between the next three years global annual solar installations will average 135 gigawatts Meanwhile the global tracker market will see a 45 percent increase in installations from 2020 2025 The promoter of the company has 8 years of rich experience in the solar industry with various verticals in the same domain The company has applied for patents in India EU UK USA Canada but currently our operations are going on in Delhi The patent in USA has also been granted We are also aiming to expand our operations in Toronto Canada We spent that last couple of years in getting the patents registered and R D process Have high growth rate as we focused on customer acquisition this year whereas last year our focus was on getting patented ,11,Sustainable Energy
