# VeriVent App By Team Meraki ðŸš€

Verivent is an app that enables investors to verify the status of Nigerian startups. It serves as a platform where startups of Nigerian origin can register on and get verified using the various verification options available using the Verified Africa API integration.
It is also be a repository for startups looking for funding, where the startups can outline their sharable business information and identity related data in a very secured environment.
Investors and Venture capitalists san also use the app to find trust-worthy startups -with legitimate owners- to invest in.

This project was built by Team Meraki for the Ingressive for Good X Verified Africa's Hackathon 2022.
